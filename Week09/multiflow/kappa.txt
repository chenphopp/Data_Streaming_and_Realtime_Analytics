Cohen's Kappa

- The kappa coefficient measures the agreement between classification and truth values. 
A kappa value of 1 represents perfect agreement, while a value of 0 represents no agreement. The kappa coefficient is computed as follows:

k = (p0 - pe)/(1-pe) 
*p0 = The observerd proportionate agreement, pe= probability of random agreement
k = -1...1
Example a group of 50 people, two reviewers (Mr.A,B), yes no
            	    	B
    		yes 	| 	no
  yes |  	a (20)  |  	b (5)
A 
  no  |  	c (10)  |  	d (15)

p0 = a + d
    _______ = (20+15)/50 = 0.7
    a+b+c+d

pe -> A said "Yes" to 25 people (a+b) out of 50 people. Thus, A said "Yes" 50% of the time.
   -> B said "Yes" to 30 people (a+c) out of 50 people. Thus, B said "Yes" 60% of the time.
   -> A said "No" to 25 people (a+b) out of 50 people. Thus, A said "No" 50% of the time.
   -> B said "No" to 20 people (a+c) out of 50 people. Thus, B said "No" 40% of the time.

So, the expected prob. that both A and B would say yes at random is p_yes = (a+b)/(a+b+c+d) x (a+c)/(a+b+c+d) = 0.5*0.6 = 0.3
    the expected prob. that both A and B would say no at random is p_no = (c+d)/(a+b+c+d) x (b+d)/(a+b+c+d) = 0.5*0.4 = 0.2
    
pe = p_yes (A and B) + p_no (A and B)
Then, pe = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5
Thus, k = (0.7-0.5)/(1-0.5) = 0.4

Rule
< 0 no agreement
0-0.2 = slight, 
0.21 - 0.4 = fair, 
0.41-0.6 = moderate agreement, 
0.61 - 0.8 = substantial agreement, 
0.81 - 1 = perfect agreement
