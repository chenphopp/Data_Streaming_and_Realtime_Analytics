# Semester 2/2563

**9.2 Video game and data analytics**
+ Get python game from [4]
+ pip install pygame (If you don't have it.)
    - If you don't want to play the game in a fullscreen mode, you can comment line 419 of space_wars.py out and then uncomment line 418 of the same file.
+ Real-time data analytics in video games [5]
    - Which Metrics Matter?
    
| Metric	     | Definition & Use|
| ---------------| --------------- |
| ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) | Total number of unique players divided by total revenue in a given period. Can gauge the general business health of your game. |
| ARPPU (Average Revenue per Paying User) |	Like ARPU but limited to purchasing players. Useful for gauging monetization strategies, such as in-game store design or store price points.  |
| Unique Logins	| Fairly self-explanatory, used to monitor active player population.|
| Conversion Rate	| Total number of players who made purchases divided by unique logins. Gauges how well you convert free users into paid users.|
| Retention  | Total number of players that logged into your game during two specific date ranges. Common gaps between reporting periods are 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day measures.  |
| Avg. Session Length | Another self-explanatory metric, used to gauge how long your gameplay loop is fun or keeps players' attention.  |
| Session Frequency  | Number of players logged in, divided by the total number of login events. Gauges how often players engage with the game.   |
| LTV (Lifetime Value)  | Total number of unique players divided by total revenue generated. Gauges how high your ROI (return on investment) is per player.  |
| Errors  | Counts errors generated by code. Gauges how stable your game is.  |
| Content Logs  | Counts occurrences of specific logs unique to your game's content being triggered. Gauges popularity, stability, and engagement of specific content.  |

+ Best game document but Apache beam examples [7]


**9.3 Setup Kafka on AWS**
